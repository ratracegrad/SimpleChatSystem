      <h2>Who are we?</h2>
      <div>
        Hello, we are Ching Chang and Voovs, we are the developers of Dorpn. We are in high school
        and we love programming in our spare time. Voovs came up with the idea of the site and
        styled the main framework, while Ching Chang programmed the backend, styled some minor
        components, and scaled the site for mobile. This is the first company we started and we
        really hope to make it simple yet useful.

      <h2>Why Dorpn?</h2>
      <div>
        Coming up with a site name was the hardest thing about this project. When we first started the
        project, we just named our files <em>SimpleChatSystem</em> and thought that we didn't have
        to worry about the name until the site is almost done. It turned out that we finished the
        site in five days and we were at the time of coming up with a site name. We had completely
        no idea how to name our site. Ching Chang even went on a walk for more than an hour outside
        to search for inspiration. We flipped through the dictionary and tried to pull up some
        random words. Some words we came up with included Boron, Ivory, Fractals, Constant, and
        Inter (because inter.com and intercom). However, all words with the extension of .com were
        taken by cybersquatters. We had to either create new words or use more than one word. After
        joking about naming our site <em>fairisfoulfoulisfairhoverthroughthefogandfilthyair.com</em>
        to avoid cybersquatters, Voovs decided that it would be more professional to only use one
        word instead of using multiple words or phrases. The day after, Ching Chang thought that
        chatting with other people online is like talking through a door, and our site opens that
        door for the users. We combined the word door and open and called it Dorpen. Unfortunately,
        dorpen.com and doorpen.com are both premium domains that cost about $1,500 CAD, so we dropped
        the e and our site was born!
